Follow the guide in the README.\\nIf none of these fix the issue, please open an issue on the Github repository: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-image-picker\");\n  }\n\n  var _default = ImagePickerManager;\n  exports.default = _default;\n});","map":[[7,0,10,0],[9,0,13,0],[9,6,13,6,"ImagePickerManager"],[9,24,13,61],[9,27,14,2,"NativeModules"],[9,54,14,16,"ImagePickerManager"],[9,72,13,0],[11,0,17,0],[11,6,17,4],[11,7,17,5,"ImagePickerManager"],[11,25,17,0],[11,27,17,25],[12,0,18,2],[12,10,18,8],[12,14,18,12,"Error"],[12,19,18,8],[12,839,18,2],[13,0,25,1],[15,17,31,15,"ImagePickerManager"],[15,35]]},"type":"js/module"}]}
